 Machine Learning WebApp for Puppy's Brain


## About
This Dash app allows the logging of a dog's activities (Eating, Bathroom, etc.) to a Google Cloud Query server set up remotely. 

Features consist of 'time since last _activity_', 'number of _activity_ in last hour', 'time', 'day of week', and a subjective 'good-boy ranking'

Upon running the dash instance, a Random Forest model is run that predicts the current probabilities of each activity and is updated live based on continued logging and time.
